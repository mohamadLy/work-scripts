# work-scripts

some automated day to day task 

# vap-setup.exp is expect script that automate the configuration and
and provisionning of virtual ap by creating the all the necessary profiles
such as (virtual-ap profile, ssid profiel, aaa profile, ht-ssid-profile, 
			ap system profile, and ap-group profile )
vap-setup.exp script is also a great way to learn how aruba profiles work 
and the relationship between them

# giving credit where credit is due
vap-setup.exp script has been inspired from junior's script and had reused many part of that script
